Phase 2- I analysed the data, the datatypes and used a threshold of 80% to drop a column. Used simple imputer for missing values, initally used KNN but the computation was very slow. Imputed categories with missing value.Used label encoder and one hot encoding for categories.

Phase 3- Applied XGBoost and Random forest and compared their result with R2 and RMSE. 

Phase 4- Used test file for predictions. First aligned columns according to training set used same imputation and ecoding methods on test set.
Used both models on it.
